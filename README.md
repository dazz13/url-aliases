# URL Aliases

URL Aliases is a Chrome extension that allows users to create aliases (short
strings) for websites so that they don't have to remember or type long URLs for
commonly visited websites.

This is a modification of the [Web
Aliases](https://chromewebstore.google.com/detail/web-aliases/hdempabimjppagbgpiglikbobneoegmp)
extension. The UI is simpler looking and has a quick-add feature. If you're on a
page that you want to add an alias for, all you have to do is click the
extension icon (or type the keyboard shortcut, Alt+A on a Mac), then type the
alias. The current page is automatically used as the URL. Of course you can
easily edit the URL; just tab over to it.

For short aliases such as a single letter, Chrome will of course offer an
autocomplete. To use the alias, just type a space to clear the autocomplete.

The code is available on [github](https://github.com/dazz13/url-aliases).
